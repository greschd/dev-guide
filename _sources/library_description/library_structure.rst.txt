Library Structure
=================
All PyAnsys libraries are expected to follow a consistent pattern for:

  - Project, repository, and library names
  - Repository directory structure
  - Licensing
  - Package configuration in the ``setup.py`` file
  - Unit testing
  - CI/CD using Azure DevOps or GitHub Workflow Actions
  - Documentation
