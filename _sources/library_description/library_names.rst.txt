Project, Repository, and Library Names
######################################
Large organizations providing Python packages 
follow a consistent naming pattern. Ansys follows 
these naming conventions: 

- The project name is to be ``Py<project>``. For example, 
  ``PyMAPDL`` is the project name for MAPDL and ``PyAEDT`` 
  is the project name for AEDT.
- The repository name as hosted on GitHub should be all 
  lowercase to follow GitHub community standards. For 
  example, `pymapdl`_ and `pyaedt`_.
- The Python library name is to be in the format 
  ``ansys-<product/service>-<feature>``. For example, 
  `ansys-mapdl-core <https://pypi.org/project/ansys-mapdl-core/>`_ 
  is the name for the core MAPDL library. 

Using long Python library names provides two primary advantages:

- `Namespace Packages`_ can be used to designate official 
  Ansys packages
- Consistent branding and style can be applied to PyAnsys libraries
