Packaging
#########
A Python package organizes and structures a Python library, which contains several
modules and assets such as examples or binary extensions. A Python package
offers an easy, reliable, and comprehensive way to distribute and install
a Python library on a variety of platforms and environments.

Namespace Packaging
-------------------
A PyAnsys library uses `namespace packaging`_.
Namespace packages allow a user to easily split subpackages from a package into
a single, independent distribution.

Three different approaches are currently available for creating a namespace package:

* `native namespace packages`_
* pkgutil-style namespace packages
* pkg_resources-style namespace packages

Required Files
--------------

* README.rst file: Describes the purpose of the package.
  *The format of this file must be reStructuredText.*

* LICENSE file: Specifies copyrights and required authorization.

* setup.py file: Provides package information.
  The presence of this file indicate that the package was likely created using ``disutils``,
  which is the Python standard for building and distributing a Python package.


Setup File
----------
The `setup.py`_ file is the build script for ``setuptools``. It exposes dynamic metadata and contains
package information, such as a description, author, and version.
In this file, the ``setuptools`` module is used to configure the metadata (as opposed to ``distutils``).

.. code:: python

  import setuptools
  setuptools.setup(...)

This file gathers all namespace packages and files that must be included in the distributed
package.

.. code:: python

  packages = []
  for package in setuptools.find_namespace_packages(include='ansys*'):
      if package.startswith('ansys.tools.example_coverage'):
          packages.append(package)


It also extracts the version number from the ``_version.py`` file located in the 
``ansys/<product>/library`` directory of the source code.


Generate the Package and Upload It on PyPI
------------------------------------------

The first time that you want to upload a package on PyPI under the `ansys <https://pypi.org/user/ansys/>`_ 
account, you must perform the following process manually.

Create the python package.

.. code::

  python setup.py sdist

Verify the distribution's long description rendering with ``twine``.

.. code::

  pip install twine
  twine check dist/*

Upload the package to PyPI using ``twine`` and the upload token generated for the ``ansys`` PyPI account. 
Contact alexander.kaszynski@ansys.com for the token.

.. code::

  python -m twine upload -u __token__ -p <TOKEN_FOR_PYPI> --skip-existing dist/*

For the next release upload, you can do it through the CI/CD workflow after generating a token just for this package.
Create a `secret`_ in GitHub settings.
Name it ``PYPI_TOKEN`` and assign it the token provided by PyPI.
This token will be reused in the CI/CD workflow handling the package distribution.

Tag a Release
-------------
To deploy a new package on PyPI, you must tag a release under a release branch. The PyAnsys project
follows the `trunk-based development`_ source-control branching model, where the main development
branch is always in a releasable state.

To tag the release, update your main local branch.

.. code::

  git checkout main
  git pull

Then, create a release branch.

.. code::

  git checkout -b release/MAJOR.MINOR

Bump the version number in the ``_version`` file to ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``.

Commit and push your changes and then create the tag.

.. code::

  git commit -am "Increase version to v<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>"
  git tag v<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>
  git push --tags

Following this tag creation, the workflow responsible for the distribution
will be automatically triggered.

Install a Package
-----------------
Install a package with:

.. code::

  pip install ansys.<product>.<library>

To create a package complying with the above standards, here is the minimal content of your PyAnsys library:

.. code::

   ansys/<product>/<library>/__init__.py
   LICENSE
   README.rst
   setup.py
   tests/
