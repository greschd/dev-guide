Coding Style
************

PyAnsys libraries are expected to follow `PEP8`_ and
be consistent in style and formatting with the "big three"
data science libraries: `NumPy`_, `SciPy`_, and `pandas`_.

.. _NumPy: https://numpy.org/
.. _SciPy: https://www.scipy.org/
.. _pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/
.. _PEP8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/


.. todo::

   * Describe flake8 standards (in subpage), include example ``.flake8``
     with minimum standards.
   * Include anything we've written from other documentation either in
     this page or other pages.
